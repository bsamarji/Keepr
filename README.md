Keepr is a secure, cross-platform command-line password manager designed for software developers.
It stores your credentials in an encrypted [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) database that lives **entirely on your local machine**, ensuring complete control over your data. 
No servers, no cloud syncing — just strong, local encryption.

The vault is protected by a **Master Password** derived into a strong encryption key using an industry-standard PBKDF2-HMAC key derivation function (SHA256, 1.2M iterations).
Your data remains safe even if the database or key files are compromised.

## 🧠 Why Keepr?

As a developer, you constantly handle sensitive data — API keys, repository tokens, SSH passwords, and configuration secrets. 
Keepr was built to simplify that workflow by letting you **store, search, and retrieve secrets directly from the terminal**, without switching tools or exposing plaintext data.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Install Keepr from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/keepr/):

```bash
pip install keepr

keepr login # Set or unlock the master password

keepr add github # Add a credential

keepr view github # Retrieve entry securely
```

That’s it — your credentials are stored locally, fully encrypted, and accessible only through your master key.

* 🔑 Master Password — Derives a Key Encryption Key (KEK) with PBKDF2-HMAC.
* 🕒 Timed Sessions — Stay logged in for convenience, auto-lock after expiry.
* 🧭 Vault Management — Add, update, list, search, or delete credentials.
* 🧰 Password Generator — Cryptographically secure, configurable length.
* 🧼 Clipboard Copy — Automatically copy passwords to the clipboard when viewing an entry.
* 🎨 Custom Color Scheme — Clear, high-contrast terminal output.
* ⚙️ User configuration — Configure the session length, the terminal output color scheme and password generator settings.

## 📦 Installation

Keepr supports macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install keepr
```

Or download standalone binaries from the [github releases page](https://github.com/bsamarji/Keepr/releases).

For full installation instructions read the [docs guide](https://bsamarji.github.io/Keepr/).

---

## 🛡️ Security at a Glance

Keepr uses a two-key encryption system:
* KEK (Key Encryption Key) — derived from your Master Password
* PEK (Primary Encryption Key) — encrypts the SQLCipher vault
* The PEK is stored only in encrypted form; the KEK is never written to disk.

Read about the full encryption architecture in the [docs](https://bsamarji.github.io/Keepr/encryption/).

## 🗺 Roadmap

Planned future features and improvements:

- ⌨️ Shell autocompletion for Keepr commands and arguments.
- 🧪 Password strength checks.
- 🧵 Bulk import/export of entries.
- 🔄 A copy command, which copies a password for an entry to the clipboard, without displaying any info on screen.
- 🧩 A generate command, which just generates a password and displays it on screen (separate to the -g option for the add command).
- 🛡️ Optional Two-factor authentication.
